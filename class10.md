# What is a Stack?

A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

* terminology for a stack is: 
    1. Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
    2. Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped.
    3. Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack.
    4. IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.
