## What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”
Cookies are read server-side, and local storage is read client-side, so if the server needs the data, then it is better to use cookies.

## How do pixel tags work?
Pixel tags are typically single pixel, transparent GIF images that are added to a web page. Even though the pixel tag is virtually invisible, it is still served just like any other image you may see online.

## Explain 3rd party cookies.

Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a website other than the one you are currently on. For example, you can have a “Like” button on your website which will store a cookie on a visitor’s computer, that cookie can later be accessed by Facebook to identify visitors and see which websites he visited.

## Terms

* **cookies:** Cookies are text files with small pieces of data — like a username and password — that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network. Specific cookies known as HTTP cookies are used to identify specific users and improve your web browsing experience.


* **Authorization:** allowing a user to access or to do something.

* **access control:**Fundamental component of data security that dictates who’s allowed to access and use company information and resources. Through authentication and authorization, access control policies make sure users are who they say they are and that they have appropriate access to company data.

* **Conditional Rendering:** The ability to render different user interface (UI) markup if a condition is true or false. In React, it allows us to render different elements or components based on a condition.

## Redux 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reduxjs/redux/master/logo/logo-title-dark.png)

* is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. Similar to (and inspired by) Facebook’s Flux architecture, it was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark.


* Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. As the application grows, it becomes difficult to keep it organized and maintain data flow. Redux solves this problem by managing application’s state with a single global object called Store.

* Redux is strict about how code should be organized, which makes it easier for someone with knowledge of Redux to understand the structure of any Redux application.
