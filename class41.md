## Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
Ducks is a way to bundle reducers, action types, and actions into the same file. Rather than splitting up related code, it can be packaged into redux modules. Redux Toolkit’s goal is to help simplify common Redux use cases. It is not intended to be a complete solution for everything you might want to do with Redux, but it should make a lot of Redux-related code you need to write a lot simpler. Redux Toolkit exports several individual functions that you can use in your application, and adds in dependencies on some other packages that are commonly used with Redux.

## What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code.

* React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android. 

* Facebook’s JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but instead of targeting the browser, it targets mobile platforms. 

* React has proved tremendously successful, both on my own projects, and with many others around the web, including large companies like Netflix.

* React Native also refers to a fantastic, collaborative community of developers from all around the globe. We combed through blogs and social media networks to compile a list of the greatest React Native specialists and blogs.

* **Expo** is a framework and a platform for universal React applications.
