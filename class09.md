* **OAuth** is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.

* OAuth can be used:
    1. as an authorizing mechanism to access secured RSS/ATOM feeds.
    2.  as a means to log in without creating an account on any site and all the benefits of the host of the OAuth system.

* **The Authorization Server**
This is the server that presents the interface where the user approves or denies the request. In smaller implementations, this may be the same server as the API server, but larger scale deployments will often build this as a separate component.

* OAuth 2 provides several "grant types" for different use cases. The grant types defined are:
    * **Authorization Code**for apps running on a web server, browser-based and mobile apps
    * **Password** for logging in with a username and password (only for first-party apps)
    * **Client credentials** for application access without a user present
    * **Implicit** was previously recommended for clients without a secret, but has been superseded by using the Authorization Code grant with PKCE. 

#### Authorization in Web server App

* Create a "Log In" link sending the user to:
    - response_type=code - Indicates that your server expects to receive an authorization code
    - client_id - The client ID you received when you first created the application
    - redirect_uri - Indicates the URI to return the user to after authorization is complete
    - scope - One or more scope values indicating which parts of the user's account you wish to access
    - state - A random string generated by your application, which you'll verify later

* The user sees the authorization prompt

- if the user clicks "Allow," the service redirects the user back to your site with an auth code.
    * code - The server returns the authorization code in the query string
    * state - The server returns the same state value that you passed
