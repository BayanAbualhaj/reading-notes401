## When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?


|    Basic Authorization  | Bearer Authorization |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| **Use case**      | **Use case**       |
| The use case for this are integration with reporting tools  | It is the recommended Authentication methods whenever possible. It is ideal when scripting, when developing external app or when doing integration with external tools.       |
| The basis Auth allow you to access the API directly with your credential : user/password.   | To access the API with a bearer token you will need to make 2 call          |

## What does the JSON Web Token package do?

* JSON Web Token is a standard used to create access tokens for an application.

* the server generates a token that certifies the user identity, and sends it to the client.

* The client will send the token back to the server for every subsequent request, so the server knows the request comes from a particular identity.

## What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
![secret](https://www.testpreptraining.com/tutorial/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-252-343x400.png)

1. Never store unencrypted secrets in .git repositories.
    * Add sensitive files in .gitignore
    * Don’t rely on code reviews to discover secrets
    * Use automated secrets scanning on repositories.

2. Don't share your secrets unencrypted in messaging systems like slack.
3. Restrict API access and permissions.
    - Default to minimal permission scope for APIs
    - Whitelist IP addresses where appropriate
    - Use short-lived secrets

* **Encryption** is the method by which information is converted into secret code that hides the information's true meaning. The science of encrypting and decrypting information is called cryptography.


* **token** is a single element of a programming language. There are five categories of tokens:
     1. constants 
     2. identifiers
     3. operators
     4. separators
     5. reserved words.

* **Bearer authentication**  is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request.

* **Secrets** refers to the tools and methods for managing digital authentication credentials (secrets), including passwords, keys, APIs, and tokens for use in applications, services, privileged accounts and other sensitive parts of the IT ecosystem.

* **JSON Web Token (JWT)** is a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

## [5 steps to simple role-based access control (RBAC)](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3060780/5-steps-to-simple-role-based-access-control.html)

* **RBAC** is nothing more than the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. The system needs of a given workforce are analyzed, with users grouped into roles based on common job responsibilities and system access needs.


* Benefits of RBAC:
**With the proper implementation of RBAC, the assignment of access rights becomes systematic and repeatable. Further, it is much easier to audit user rights, and to correct any issues identified.**

- **Access control lists (ACL)** — An ACL is a means of defining access rights by a given user or user group, to a specific object, such as a document. 

- **Attribute-based access control (ABAC)** sometimes known as policy-based access control, can use a variety of attributes, including user department, time of day, location of access, type of access required, etc. to determine whether a user’s access request should be granted.
